Heliotrope Zero

Game Instructions

Survive waves of evil robot bugs for 5 minutes while your mechs charge up.  Use the turrets or go out on foot and fight them.  
Don't let the recharge core get destroyed.. recharge cores don't react well to bullets.
When your mechs have charged up - use them to jump out of the base (if its still standing) and escape to the dropship before its too late!
